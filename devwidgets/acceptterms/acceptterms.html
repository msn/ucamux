<h5>Draft Terms and Conditions</h5>

<p>Academic Collaboration Environment is a service provided by the University of
Cambridge, using the Cambridge University Data Network (CUDN) and JANET, and
its use is governed by the following university-wide policies:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/isss/rules/">Rules and Guidelines of the ISSS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/hr/policy/computer.html">Acceptable use of computer facilities, email and the internet</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/cs/network/rules/">Rules governing use of the CUDN</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ja.net/company/policies/aup.html">JANET acceptable use policy</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>By using Academic Collaboration Environment you agree to abide by the rules set
out by the University of Cambridge and JANET.</p>

<h6> Privacy defaults in the Academic Collaboration Environment</h6>

<p>Your user ID (CRSID for University of Cambridge users), first name and last
name comprise your Basic Profile Information in the Academic Collaboration
Environment.  Because the Academic Collaboration Environment is intended to
enable collaboration and engagement outside as well as inside the University,
Basic Profile Information is visible to anyone visiting the website, not just
logged in users or members of the University.</p>

<p>University of Cambridge users logging in to the Academic Collaboration
Environment via Raven will on first login be given the option to import their
first name and last name automatically from the University Lookup Directory.
You may opt out of this by making the appropriate selection.  Not including
your name in your Basic Profile Information will prevent anyone visiting the
Academic Collaboration Environment website from finding you by searching on
your name.  You will be discoverable only by your CRSID.  Conversely, including
your name means that if someone searches for your name, they will also be able
to see your CRSID.</p>

<p>Non-University of Cambridge users (“Friends”) are required to give their name.</p>

<p>By default, files you upload, groups you belong to, and profile information
that you provide will be visible to anyone with an Academic Collaboration
Environment account. These accounts will be available to members of the
university and invited external members. This means that unless you
deliberately change who can see a given piece of information, the information
will be visible to Academic Collaboration Environment account holders.  When
you become a member of a public group or site, or participate in one, you
should be aware that you are acting in the public domain.</p>

<p>Please also see our associated <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p>

<p>If you are concerned about these terms and conditions, please contact
helpdesk@caret.cam.ac.uk.</p>

<h6>Adjustments to these Terms and Conditions</h6>

<p>Any changes to these Terms and Conditions will be notified to users by
appropriate means.</p>
